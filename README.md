Discord Bots for Pokémon GO Players

This Project contains four characterised bots, each performing different functions

### The Pokédex
Stores general information about Pokémon including evolution, eggs and images.

* When the commamd !pokedex or !p is called followed by a Pokémon's name or number, the Pokédex entry for that Pokémon is returned.

### Professor Oak
Professor Oak knows all about where you can catch Pokémon.

* When the command !find or !f is called followed by a Pokémon's name or number, the top known locations for that Pokemon are returned.
* When the command !caught or !c is called followed by a Pokémon's name or number and location, that sighting is recorded for the Pokémon.

### Officer Jenny
Officer Jenny maintains the channel and is there to help.

* When the command !help or !h is called, Officer Jenny will provide users in the channel a list of available commands.

### Nurse Joy
I have no idea what Nurse Joy does yet, but she's cute.
